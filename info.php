      <h2>What is a 3D printer?</h2>
      <p>
        A 3D printer is a machine that can print three-dimensional objects 
        out of hard colored plastic. In order to print, a design must 
        first be made either using software that can be found for 
        free online or by making use of an object scanner.
      </p>

      <h2>Using Truman's 3D printer</h2>
      <p>
        Students can print any design they have using this website. First,
        upload your design to the Makerbot Thingiverse then go to 
        the print page and fill out a request form. Your project
        will be added to the queue, and you will recieve an email when 
        it is ready to be picked up from the Magruder office. 3D printed 
        objects are $0.10 per gram to be payed on pickup.
      </p>

      <h2>Things to know before printing</h2>
      <ul>
